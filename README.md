Udacity Front End Nanodegree Project Three: Classic Arcade Game
===============================

## Introduction
In project three, I will be working from a foundation of visual assets and a game engine provided as starting files to develop an arcade game in the style of *Frogger* using ES6-style object-oriented features.

The following game description is referenced from Udacity's own guidelines introducing the project.

## How The Game Works

In this game you have a Player and Enemies (Bugs). The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies. Using the keyboard's arrow keys, the player can move left, right, up and down. The enemies move in varying speeds on the paved block portion of the scene. Once a the player collides with an enemy, the game is reset and the player moves back to the start square. Once the player reaches the water the game is won.

Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.
