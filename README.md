Classic Arcade Game Project
===============================

## Introduction
In project three, I will be working from a foundation of visual assets and a game engine provided as starter files to develop an arcade game in the style of *Frogger* using ES6-style object-oriented programming paradigms.

The following game description is referenced from Udacity's own guidelines introducing the project.

## How The Game Works

In this game you have a Player and Enemies (Bugs). The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies. Using the keyboard's arrow keys, the player can move left, right, up and down. The enemies move in varying speeds on the paved block portion of the scene. Once a the player collides with an enemy, the game is reset and the player moves back to the start square. Once the player reaches the water the game is won.
